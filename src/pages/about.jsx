          <p>
            I'm Tam, a passionate software developer and tech enthusiast. I love building applications that make a difference and enjoy learning new technologies every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            My journey in programming started with curiosity and has grown into a drive to solve real-world problems through clean, scalable code. Whether itâ€™s a frontend design or backend logic, I enjoy every part of the development cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy participating in hackathons, exploring open-source contributions, and occasionally diving into competitive programming.
